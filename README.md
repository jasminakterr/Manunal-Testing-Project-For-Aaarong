# Manunal-Testing-Project-For-Aaarong
# Goal of Testing Aarong Website Application
The key concept testing "Aarong" is to ensure that the application is error free and it is working in conformance to the specified functional requirements. In test case writing for the "Aarong" website, I worked on the "Sign Up & Login" features and found some errors.

# Test Plan
At first done the test planning for better understanding about the project and overview all over the app. Writing a test plan for manual testing is crucial for organizing and standardizing the testing process. It ensures that testing is thorough, consistent, and aligned with the projectâ€™s objectives.  So that when write test cases it helps to understand the functionality.
# Mind Map
Creating a mind map for manual testing provides a visual and intuitive way to organize and communicate the testing process. It helps testers break down complex ideas, prioritize tasks, and ensure comprehensive coverage of testing scenarios.

# Test Scenarios
Writing test scenarios for manual testing is an essential step in the quality assurance process. Test scenarios help ensure that all possible actions and workflows within the application are tested effectively.
# Test Case Writing
Main part of the project. After doing all the things that helps to write and execute the test cases more specific. In this project all the test cases have been executed without having any delay. There are 94 Pass test cases and 10 Fail test cases. It only for the Sign Up and Login feature. There I maintain a sequence of testing:
- Browser Compatibility
- UI testing
- Functional testing
- Usability testing
# Test Summary
A test summary for manual testing is an essential part of the testing lifecycle. It provides a comprehensive overview of the testing process, outcomes, and overall product quality.
# Bug Report
Bug reports is a critical activity in manual testing, as it provides a structured way to document and communicate issues discovered during the testing process. The number of bugs discovered in test case writing is concentrated in this section. As we already know from the previous section (Test Case Writing), 10 test cases failed. #SL-11,22,23,24,27,28,29,36,68,88 denotes the errors identified and written on those rows in the 10 bug reporting boxes below.
# Test Metrics
Test metrics for manual testing is essential for measuring, analyzing, and improving the testing process and the overall quality of the product. Test metrics provide quantifiable data to track the progress, efficiency, and effectiveness of testing activities.
